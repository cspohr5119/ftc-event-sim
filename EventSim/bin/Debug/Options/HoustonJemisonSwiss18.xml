<!-- 
These options will run an event with teams from an actual event, but schedule them
with the Swiss system and assign OPR values as scores.  This is helpful when comparing Random vs Swiss outcomes.
-->

<!-- 
  EventKey is found in the URL for the event at https://theorangealliance.org
  Supported SchedulingModel values are "SwissScheduling", "RandomScheduling"
  Supported TBPMethod values are "LosingScore", "WinningScore", "OwnScore", "TotalScore"
  ScoreRandomness is a value between 0 and 1.  This will give a random component to teams 
    score where score = PPM +/- (PPM * ScoreRandomness).  The random factor conforms to
    a Laplace distribution, with a dense center peak, controlled by the RandomTightness option.
    The skew will provide a longer tail on one side or the other.  Less than 1.0 puts the longer
    tail on the left as observed in data from actual events.
  OPRmmse 1-3 recommended, 0 for traditional OPR calculation.
  TBPExpression is a mathematical expression that will be used if TBPMethod is "Expression"  It will
    evaluate a forumla containing bracketed variables [WinningScore], [LosingScore], and/or [OwnScore]
  TeamOPRFile is a comma-delimited file of Team,OPR to use instead of an EventKey.
  EventKey must be blank to use TeamOPRFile.  RandomScheduling.UseFTCSchedule and UseFTCResults 
    will be forced false.
