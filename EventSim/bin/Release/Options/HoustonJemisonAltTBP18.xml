<!-- 
These options will run an theoretical event with a provided list of teams and OPR values.
-->

<!-- 
  EventKey is found in the URL for the event at https://theorangealliance.org
  Supported SchedulingModel values are "SwissScheduling", "RandomScheduling"
  Supported TBPMethod values are "LosingScore", "WinningScore", "OwnScore", "TotalScore"
  ScoreRandomness is a value between 0 and 1.  This will give a random component to teams 
    score where score = PPM +/- (PPM * ScoreRandomness).  The random factor conforms to
    a Laplace distribution, with a dense center peak, controlled by the RandomTightness option.
    The skew will provide a longer tail on one side or the other.  Less than 1.0 puts the longer
    tail on the left as observed in data from actual events.
  OPRmmse 1-3 recommended, 0 for traditional OPR calculation.
  TBPExpression is a mathematical expression that will be used if TBPMethod is "Expression"  It will
    evaluate a forumla containing bracketed variables [WinningScore], [LosingScore], and/or [OwnScore]
  TeamOPRFile is a comma-delimited file of Team,OPR to use instead of an EventKey.
  EventKey must be blank to use TeamOPRFile.  RandomScheduling.UseFTCSchedule and UseFTCResults 
    will be forced false.
